# Calling Gemini with OpenAI API

OpenAI compatibility

Gemini models are accessible using the OpenAI libraries (Python and TypeScript / Javascript) along with the REST API, by updating three lines of code and using your Gemini API key. If you aren't already using the OpenAI libraries, we recommend that you call the Gemini API directly.

```bash
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer GEMINI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
    "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain to me how AI works"}
    ]
    }'
```
